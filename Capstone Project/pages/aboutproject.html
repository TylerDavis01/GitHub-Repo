            <li>Create a modern HTML page with linked CSS and JavaScript files.</li>
            <li>Use modern JavaScript to create, set values, and append elements to the DOM.</li>
            <li>Demonstrate use of proper conditional logic (eg. if...else, switch statements.</li>
            <li>Create custom JavaScript functions that accept parameters and return values.</li>
            <li>Use template literals to combine strings and embedded expressions.</li>
            <li>Create JavaScript objects with properties and methods.</li>
            <li>Use modern JavaScript Array methods to create, append, copy, or delete items from arrays.</li>
            <li>Load an external JSON file or Fetch remote JSON data (e.g. from a favorite API) and display the data in your web page.</li>
            <li>Ensure your page is modern, looks nice and professional, and runs without errors.</li>
            <li>Deploy your page to Netlify using your Github repository.</li>

        <h2>How Objectives Were Accomplished</h2>
        <br>
        <ul class="objectives">
            <li>Visual Studio Code is installed on my PC and I used it when building this project.</li>
            <li>Page was created using modern techniques and has CSS & JS files linked properly.</li>
            <li>I use innerHTML functions to append elements on the DOM in the main.js file.</li>
            <li>A switch statement is used when determining what solar zone the user is in.</li>
            <li>The "addMonths" function in the main.js file accepts an element object and uses it in the function.</li>
            <li>I use template literals to create the dynamic return text in the additional details section.</li>
            <li>I create and use a JavaScript object in data.js that is used for JSON data on the products.html page.</li>
            <li>I use an array to store the data brought in when the "calculatePanel" function is run.</li>
            <li>I loaded JSON data from the JavaScript object in the data.js file. This data was then put into the description of each product on the product.html page.</li>
            <li>Page was designed with simplicity in mind as well as modern CSS practices such as bootstrap cards on the products page. The page returns no errors and works as expected.</li>
            <li>Website was successfully deployed on Netlify as well as the code was published to Github.</li>
        </ul>
